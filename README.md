Reproducibility and Validation of a Computational Framework for Architectural Semantics: A Methodological Study with Japanese Architectural Concepts

Note: This repository provides the data and code for the peer review of the accompanying manuscript.

This repository contains the complete dataset, models, and Python code to reproduce the results and figures for the paper: "Reproducibility and Validation of a Computational Framework for Architectural Semantics: A Methodological Study with Japanese Architectural Concepts."

How to Reproduce the Results

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the full analysis pipeline.

1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/ArchiScrub/Reproducibility-and-Validation-of-a-Computational-Framework-for-Architectural-Semantics.git](https://github.com/ArchiScrub/Reproducibility-and-Validation-of-a-Computational-Framework-for-Architectural-Semantics.git)


2. Set Up the Environment

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

All required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


The file Package_Version.txt lists key package versions used in the original study for verification.

3. Run the Analysis

The main script Paper 1.py will run the entire pipeline. It loads settings from config.yaml and filters.yaml and uses the data from the /txt_corpus and /models folders.

python "Paper 1.py"


4. Check the Outputs

The script will generate two main outputs:

Tabular Data: All generated CSV files will be saved in the /results folder.

Figures: All generated plots and graphs will be saved in the /figures folder.
