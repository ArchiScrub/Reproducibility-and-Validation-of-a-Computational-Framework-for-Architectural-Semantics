In this style, sliding doors called fusuma were used to separate rooms, and an inner window called shoji, which was made by pasting paper permeable to sunlight on a wooden frame, was installed inside the wooden shutters.

BERT,txt_corpus\BERT_Corpus.txt,3354,"Villa incorporates many traditional Japanese ideas. One example of Katsura's use of traditional ideas is its use of raised floors with tatami mats covering them. Tatami are mats approximately 3 feet by 6 feet in length that are not only used as the floors of the villa, but are also used to define the dimensions of each individual room and the house as a whole. At Katsura, the mats are used to create the sprawling and pinwheel-like plan that it has today. The terraces and porches created by the arrangement of the tatami mats provide opportunities to view the landscape and link interior spaces with the outside world. The floors of each building of the site are also raised as well, which originally was derived from vernacular designs for granaries, as well as early imperial palaces. They serve the purpose of both keeping the floor dry while also giving hierarchy to the space. Another classic characteristic that the Katsura Imperial Villa utilizes is the use of screen walls (the shōji and the fusuma). In traditional Japanese Architecture, the shoji and the fusuma are used to separate the spaces created by the tatami mat into the various rooms of the house. The shoji is the generic term for the white and translucent screen door or wall that is reinforced with wooden lattice and can either be stationary, hanging, or sliding. The fusuma is a subcategory of the shoji and it is the white or painted moving screen partition used on the interior of the house. By moving the fusuma, when in conjunction with a stationary shoji, the resident is able to create new rooms within the architecture. For instance by moving one fusuma wall, one could transform two rooms into one large room and a small storage closet. In the Katsura Imperial Villa, the fusuma allows the rooms to change and open up to the natural world with exterior decks becoming extensions of the interior and framing views of the landscape. An example of this type of transformation is the moon viewing platform connected to the Old Shoin. Besides these characteristics, there are many traditional Japanese ideas that are used in the Katsura Imperial Villa, like the decorative alcove (tokonoma), built-in desk (tsukeshoin) and square mails."

Tracing back to Japan’s prehistorical period, roof instead of walls has been the main body for protection which extend from the ridgepole all the way to the ground. Soon later, walls were adopted but the roof still played an important role in protecting the dwelling from rain and sun. In Japan, where driving rains are frequent, deep eaves are essential to protect the interior. This great depth was achieved when machiya (townhouses) within the city of the ancient period adopted a gently sloping hisashi (peripheral section) in addition to the moya (core section). This typology spreaded from the capital to the provincial towns and became a characteristics of the Ancient period, while the technique was incorporated into the aristocratic shinden style in the Heian period. This evolution of the roof naturally created deep covered space under the eaves where the extension of the interior flooring would become the engawa that seem to project out of the house.

However, ki is “grasped as designing in space” because it also refers to the spatializing space alongside the spatializee space. It resides in-between various dichotomies and even consists of the in-between per se. Kisho Kurokawa describes the concept of “in-betweenness,” “interpenetration existing in symbiosis” or “intermediary zone” as the main aesthetic quality in Japanese architecture. Taking this in-between-ness as the departure point, he also states that his interpretation of Japanese aesthetics is based on symbiosis. The dichotomies leading to in-between-ness interrelate and construct a unified and symbiotic body, which is echoed in the concept of aidagara 間柄, which is also described in detail by Watsuji Tetsurō (1996). The meaning of aidagara in Watsuji relates to the concepts of relationality and between-ness. Watsuji’s between-ness is the way we relate with others in a social context, and though the whole is more than the sum of its parts, individuals and community are interdependent. To define aidagara, Watsuji utilizes the concept of ningen sonzai 人間存在, in which nin 人 means “person” and gen 間 means “between” while sonzai 存在 refers to “existence”. Ningen sonzai corresponds to the existence of a human being, however, in a duality between private and barlic, and between spatial and temporal."
BERT,txt_corpus\BERT_Corpus.txt,27981,"Like aidagara and ki, there are manifold Japanese terms paving the way for interpreting Japanese architecture within a literary, and thus narrative, context. In this respect, Michael Lazarin, a scholar of the phenomenology of Japanese architecture, highlights three important keywords—en 縁, ma 間, and mu 無—in understanding the essence of Japanese spatial design. According to Lazarin, the core of Japanese architecture resides in the transitional spaces between the rooms, rather than in the rooms themselves. In Japanese, this transitional space is called en, meaning “edge” and “connection” (Lazarin 2014). In this respect, en becomes associated with the concept of aidagara, which this time is constructed between the spaces. Moreover, en can be directly found in Japanese architectural terminology: engawa 縁側 is a porch or veranda connecting rooms, like a hallway in a form continuing along at least one side of the dwelling or temple structure in order to view the yard. It is a wooden platform without mats on the floor. In advanced examples, engawa surrounds the entire structure as a ring in four directions. If the floor is covered with mats, it is topped by hisashi 廂, meaning “pent roof,” with “the galleries’ pent roof extending from the main roof”, which etymologically comes from the expression hi ga sasu 日 が射す, meaning “where the sun shines” . As also referred to by Isozaki Arata, en is a kind of hashi 橋, that is, a “bridge” between the rooms, the floor and the roof, the interior and the exterior, the building and the city, and between architecture and nature."
BERT,txt_corpus\BERT_Corpus.txt,27986,"From Tanizaki’s descriptions of Japanese aesthetics, it is possible to make a two-sided reading: a contrasting duality and transience. On the one hand, Kurokawa (2020) states that the Japanese equivalent of the concept of “duality” or having a “double code” in an aesthetic context is called wabisabi 詫寂 (詫び寂). Wabi 詫 (詫び) means “the beauty to be found in poverty and simplicity,” while sabi 寂 is the “patina” as well as “elegant simplicity”. He adopts the concept of wabi-sabi as a “symbiotic aesthetic”, and quotes Tanizaki’s (2001) symbiotic reading based on the golden lacquerware on a dark night “implying both splendor and simplicity” (Kurokawa 2020). However, in complaining about the conceptual pollution in this term, he prefers to rename wabi-sabi as hanasuki 花数寄—hana 花 means “symbiosis of heterogeneous elements, of disparate moods or feelings” (Kurokawa 2020), while suki 数寄 refers to refined taste. To justify the use of the term hanasuki, which refers to a symbiotic aesthetic, Kurokawa refers to the great tea master Sen no Rikyū and his symbiotic wabi tea balancing in an ostentatious tea room. This symbiosis, according to Kurokawa, led Rikyū “to develop wabi into an aesthetic of nothingness, of death”."

The preference of the wabi tea masters for simple, seemingly rustic objects for use in the tea ceremony led to the production of tea utensils in this style.

This is shown by thought experiments known as “prisoner’s dilemmas,” which played an increasingly important role in discussions of ethical theory in the late 20th century. The basic prisoner’s dilemma is an imaginary situation in which two prisoners are accused of a crime. If one confesses and the other does not, the prisoner who confesses will be released immediately and the prisoner who does not will be jailed for 20 years. If neither confesses, each will be held for a few months and then released. And if both confess, each will be jailed for 15 years. It is further stipulated that the prisoners cannot communicate with each other. If each of them decides what to do purely on the basis of self-interest, he will realize that it is better for him to confess than not to confess, no matter what the other prisoner does. Paradoxically, when each prisoner acts selfishly—in other words as an egoist—the result is that both are worse off than they would have been if each had acted cooperatively."
